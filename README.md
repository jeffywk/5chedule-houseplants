# Work Day Scheduler

## Goals
    * When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calender
    * When scrolled, time blocks for standard business hours are displayed
    * Time blocks are color coded to represent past or future
    * Click block to enter event, and save for that time block
    * Text for that event is saved in localStorage so event is still there upon refresh

### Everyone could be more organized. Let's do this!
